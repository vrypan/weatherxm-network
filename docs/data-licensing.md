# Data Licensing and Usage

## Commercial Use

The Association will auction licenses that allow commercial use of the Network's data for a given period of time.

Each license will grant the right to use all or part of the network’s data commercially or resell them during the license validity period. 

Indicative uses granted by the license include reselling raw data, selling the data through a REST API, building B2B or B2C services that integrate the data, using the data in proprietary weather models or building value-added services on top of the data.

::: info
The auction mechanism will be announced in Q1 2024.

## Non-commercial use

We believe that the value of the WeatherXM dataset extends much further than their commercial use.
The commercial licenses awarded through auction will not limit non-commercial uses of the Network’s data. 

**Non-commercial, personal use is and will always be free and permissionless.**

Academic use of the Network’s data will be in most cases free, but we require the institution intending to use the data to contact
us first (license@weatherxm.network) and get approval.
