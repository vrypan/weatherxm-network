# Hardware manufacturers and hardware diversity

Our vision is to open the Network to any manufacturer who wants to create devices for it and to ensure device
and data quality, the Association will:
- publish the specifications required for a station to be approved and,
- establish an approval process that hardware manufacturers will have to follow.

All devices (weather stations) that participate in the WeatherXM Network must be approved by the Association.

::: info 
The approval process has noit been formalized yet. However, if you are interested to manufacture
WeatherXM-compatible stations, please contact partner@weatherxm.com.

## Onboarding fees

For every device approved, the manufacturer must pay the onboarding fee of $100 to the Association.
We make periodic announcements about the fees collected on [our blog](https://paragraph.xyz/@weatherxm/3):

## Pre-association weather stations
As of the end of 2023, there were 7,795 weather stations participating in the WeatherXM Network.
These devices were designed and manufactured by WeatherXM AG and partner company EXM PC, before the Association was formed, and have been granted
approval by default.
